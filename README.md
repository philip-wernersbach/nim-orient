# nim-orient
OrientDB driver for the Nim language, uses the OrientDB 2.0 Binary Protocol with Binary Serialization.

## In Progress
Eventually this repository will have code in it. For now this repository is serving as a placeholder while I add more functionality to the driver and clean it up in preparation for its initial release. If you have a need for the driver code now, contact me ([Philip Wernersbach](http://github.com/philip-wernersbach)) and I'll upload it.
